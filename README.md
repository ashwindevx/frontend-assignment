# myDukaan Frontend Assignment

## Problem Statement

Create a static page in React with some dummy data that matches the provided design.

## Approach

For this assignment, I used Vite as the development environment and ReactJS as the front-end library. TailwindCSS was used for styling the page. The main focus was to match the design as close as possible.

In order to achieve this, I customized the tailwind theme in the **`tailwind.config.js`** file. I used the pre-defined set of design rules provided by tailwind for most of the design, but in certain areas where pixel-perfection was required, I used tailwind's arbitrary values. This allowed me to break out of the default constraints and match the design exactly.
